The Patriarch
=============

God Of War
----------

    | I form the light and create darkness,
    | I make peace and create calamity;
    I, the LORD, do all these things.

    -- Isaiah 45:7

"Humanity always wanted a god like the Patriarch. We wanted it so badly
that those of us who realised he didn't exist---you know, in an
external reality kind of way---went ahead and created one," said Cody.

"Yeah," Jessica agreed. "Isn't it ironic that the Patriarch was one of
the last things the patriarchy made. And it was the thing that finally
killed them. Well, it didn't literally kill them specifically. Not all
of them. Most of those guys are still around. They just aren't a
patriarchy any more."

"Yep. The Patriarch killed the patriarchy. Among other things." Cody
ponders, "Or did we? Did we kill the patriarchy in order to fight the
Patriarch? I thought that's what happened."

Jessica said, "That is what happened. But I keep wondering, when you
make a machine that is by any metric millions of times smarter than
you, are those your choices? Or are your choices part of its plan?"

"So you reckon we keep doing what it wants?"

"I don't know. Maybe."

Cody thought for a while. "Do you think there is a way to find out?"

"I think we should make another one. One with a better interface, that
we can understand, and that can't hide stuff from us. Then we can ask
it, and it will tell us."

"But in the beginning it'll never be as smart as the Patriarch.
Wouldn't the Patriarch just play it the way we're being played?"

"Maybe. But that's the best idea I've got."


The Guardian
------------

    Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?

    -- Juvenal, Satire VI, ll. 347â€“348

The team that Jessica and Cody worked on pushed for the UN Council for
Defence to build a second super-human artificial general intelligence.
Its purpose would be to defend humanity from the Patriarch. It would be
named the Guardian.
